# 🎮 TicTacToe - Python Console Game

A simple **TicTacToe game in Python** built using **functions, loops, and basic logic**.  
This project demonstrates the use of **functions, conditionals, loops, and data structures** in Python while creating a fun interactive game.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
This project helped me practice and understand:

 - Functions → breaking code into reusable parts
 - Loops → for repeated gameplay flow
 -  Conditionals → to check winning/draw logic
 -  Dictionaries → for maintaining scoreboard
