# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (Python - Jupyter Notebook)

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe, a timeless classic reimagined in Python inside a Jupyter Notebook.
This project showcases the power of functions, conditions, loops, and randomization to create an engaging two-player game.  

<br>

## ✨ Features
- 🎲 Random player selection  
- ✏️ Player name input & validation  
- ❌/⭕ Marker selection & switching  
- 🏆 Win & Draw detection  
- 🔁 Replay option after game ends  
- 📊 Scoreboard tracking for both players  
- 🚪 Quit option during gameplay

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
This project helped me practice and understand:

 - Functions → breaking code into reusable parts
 - Loops → for repeated gameplay flow
 -  Conditionals → to check winning/draw logic
 -  Dictionaries → for maintaining scoreboard
